"""Together the `Topology`, `Tile`, `Vertex`, `Edge`, and
`weavingspace.symmetry.Symmetries` classes enable extraction of the topological
structure of periodic `weavingspace.tileable.Tileable` objects so that
modification of equivalent tiles can be carried out while retaining
tileability. It is important to note that these are not fully generalised 
classes and methods, that is, the Topology object that is supported is not a 
permanent 'backing' data structure for our Tileable objects. While it might 
become that in time, as at Feb 2024 it is not such a data structure. Instead 
usage is

    tile = TileUnit(...)
    topology = Topology(tile)
    topology = topology.transform_*(...)
    new_tile = topology.tile_unit

A Topology plot function is provided for a user to be able to see what they are
doing, because how edges and vertices in a tiling are labelled under tile
equivalences is an essential step in the process.

Note that these classes do not precisely represent the distinctions made in the
mathematical literature between tiling vertices and tile corners, or between
tiling edges and tile sides.

    r"""Applies a specified transformation of elements in the Topology whose 
    labels match the selector parameter, optionally applying the transform to 
    update tile and optionally returning a new Topology object (or applying it 
    to this one). 
    
    Implemented in this way so that transformations can be applied one at a time
    without creating an intermediate set of new tiles, which may be invalid and
    fail. So, if you wish to apply (say) 3 transforms and generate a new 
    Topology leaving the existing one intact:
    
        new_topo = old_topo.transform_geometry(True,  False, "a", ...) \
                           .transform_geometry(False, False, "B", ...) \
                           .transform_geometry(False, True,  "C", ...)
    
    The first transform requests a new Topology, subsequent steps do not, and it
    is only the last step which attempts to create the new tile polygons.
    
    **kwargs supply named parameters for the requested transformation.

    Args:
      new_topology (bool): if True returns a new Topology object, else returns 
        the current Topology modified.
      apply_to_tiles (bool): if True attempts to create new Tiles after the 
        transformation has been applied. Usually set to False, unless the last
        transformation in a pipeline, to avoid problems of topologically invalid
        tiles at intermediate steps.
      selector (str): label of elements to which to apply the transformation.   
        Note that all letters in the supplied string are checked, so you can 
        use e.g. "abc" to apply a transformation to edges labelled "a", "b" or 
        "c", or "AB" for vertices labelled "A" or "B".
      type (str): name of the type of transformation requested. Currently
        supported are `zigzag_edge`, `rotate_edge`, `push_vertex`, and 
        `nudge_vertex`. Keyword arguments for each are documented in the 
        corresponding methods.

    Returns:
      Topology: if new_topology is True a new Topology based on this one with
        after transformation, if False this Topology is returned after the
        transformation.
