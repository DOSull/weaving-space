"""`TileUnit` subclass of `weavingspace.tileable.Tileable`.

Implements many 'conventional' tilings of the plane.

Examples:
  A `TileUnit` is initialised like this

    tile_unit = TileUnit(tiling_type = "cairo")

  The `tiling_type` may be one of the following

  + "cairo" the Cairo tiling more formally known as the Laves
  [3<sup>2</sup>.4.3.4] tiling. The author's favourite tiling, hence it has its
  own tiling_type.
  + "hex-slice" a range of dissections of the regular hexagon into, 2, 3, 4, 6,
  or 12 'pie slices'. The number of slices is set by specifying an additional
  argument `n`. Slices are cut either starting at the corners of  the hexagon
  or from the midpoints of hexagon edges, by specifying an additional argument
  `offset` set to either 0 or 1 respectively.
  + "hex-dissection" a range of 4, 7 or 9-fold dissections of the hexagon.
  + "laves" a range of isohedral tilings. See
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Euclidean_uniform_tilings.
  The desired tiling is specified by the additional argument `code` which is a
  string like "3.3.4.3.4". Not all the possible Laves tilings are implemented.
  + "archimedean" a range of tilings by regular polygons. See
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_tilings_by_convex_regular_polygons.
  Many of these are the dual tilings of the Laves tilings. The desired tiling
  is specified by the additional argument `code` which is a string like
  "3.3.4.3.4". Not all the possible Archimedean tilings are implemented.
  + "hex-colouring" or "square-colouring" colourings of the regular hexagonal
  and square tilings of between 2 and 10 colours, as specified by the argument
  `n`.
  + "hex-slice" or "square-slice" dissections of the regular hexagonal and
  square tilings of between 2 and 12 colours, as specified by the arguments `n`
  and `offset`.
  + "crosses" colourings of cross-shaped pentominoes of between

  Spacing and coordinate reference of the tile unit are specified by the
  `weavingspace.tileable.Tileable` superclass variables
  `weavingspace.tileable.Tileable.spacing` and
  `weavingspace.tileable.Tileable.crs`.

  Base tilings by squares, hexagons or triangles can also be requested
  using

    tile_unit = TileUnit()  # square tiling, the default
    tile_unit = TileUnit(tile_shape = TileShape.HEXAGON)
    tile_unit = TileUnit(tile_shape = TileShape.TRIANGLE)

  The first two of these have only one tile_id value, and so cannot be
  used for multivariate mapping. The triangle case has two tile_id
  values so may be useful in its base form.

  To create custom tilings start from one of the base tiles above, and
  explicitly set the `weavingspace.tileable.Tileable.tiles` variable
  by geometric construction of suitable shapely.geometry.Polygons.
  TODO: A detailed example of this usage can be found here ....
