# Geographical weaving
This is work in progress towards developing tiled 'woven' geospatial data layers for symbolisation of complex multi-attribute choropleths.  

The working code is all in R and Rmd files in this top level folder. Needed datasets to run the code are in the `data` folder.

The kind of thing we can make is this:

Some older abortive work in python is in the `python-stuff` folder.

Some sketches figuring things out are in `sketches`.

An overview of the concepts can be found on [this webpage](https://dosull.github.io/weaving-space/NZCS-Nov-2021/make-weave-map.html).

# Triaxial weaves as combinations of biaxials
