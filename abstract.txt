Weaving data into maps: a possible new approach to multivariate thematic maps 

As geospatial data become richer and more complex the need for novel approaches to display multiple attributes in thematic maps increases. Approaches that aim to present multiple attributes in single maps include bivariate choropleths which mix colours from two scales, and categorically coloured dot maps which take a 'pointillist' approach. In this presentation I will describe some ideas using the metaphor of weaving together multiple attributes in maps. A prototype approach using R is in development and I will discuss some of what we have learned from work so far. While the idea shows promise many challenges remain, particularly with respect to thematic mapping of regions with widely varying area sizes.
